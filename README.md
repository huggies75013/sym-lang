# Sym-lang Editorial Guidelines

## Purpose
These guidelines establish standards for creating, reviewing, and maintaining Sym-lang documentation, ensuring clarity, ethical considerations, and accessibility for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Precision
- Use unambiguous language with precise technical terminology
- Define all specialized terms in context and in the glossary
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout all documentation
- Illustrate concepts with concrete examples

### 2. Ethical Standards
- Ensure transparency in governance processes
- Maintain security and data integrity
- Prevent system manipulation and abuse
- Respect diverse perspectives in the triptych examples

### 3. Accessibility
- Make content understandable for both technical and non-technical users
- Use visual aids to explain complex concepts
- Provide multilingual support where possible
- Include quick-start guides alongside comprehensive documentation

## Documentation Structure Guidelines

### Structure and Format
- Begin each document with a clear title, version number, and purpose statement
- Use consistent hierarchical section numbering
- Include a table of contents for documents over 1000 words
- End with contact information for questions or contributions

### Visual Elements
- Use diagrams for relationships between concepts
- Include flowcharts for processes (governance, exception handling)
- Create tables for comparative information and taxonomies
- Ensure all visual elements have text alternatives for accessibility

### Language and Tone
- Use direct, active voice when giving instructions
- Maintain a neutral, informative tone throughout
- Avoid figurative language that could create ambiguity
- Write concisely, with one idea per paragraph

## Root Documentation Standards

### Root Creation Guidelines
- Ensure each root addresses exactly one distinct concept
- Validate that meaning is expressed in ≤140 characters
- Verify sym-code follows the `#[Prefix]-[Domain]-[Suffix]` format
- Check that metadata includes proper attribution and timestamp

### Triptych Example Quality
- **Human examples**: Focus on human interpretation, usage, or interaction with the concept
- **AI examples**: Demonstrate algorithmic or computational perspectives on the concept
- **Hybrid examples**: Show genuine collaboration, not just parallel human-AI activities
- All examples should be concrete, specific, and illustrative

### Exceptions Process Documentation
- Document clear criteria for when exceptions (#Exc-3c) are warranted
- Include step-by-step exception request procedures
- Explain how exception decisions are recorded and tracked
- Document consequences of exception approval/denial

## Governance Documentation Guidelines

### Process Transparency
- Detail every step in the governance workflow with timeframes
- Document how votes are counted, validated, and recorded
- Specify quorum requirements and approval thresholds precisely
- Include appeal processes for contested decisions

### Security Documentation
- **Anti-Sybil measures**: Document identity verification protocols
- **Abuse prevention**: Detail rate limiting and validation safeguards
- **Circuit-breaker mechanisms**: Specify exact trigger conditions
- **Data integrity**: Explain cryptographic validation methods
- **Audit trails**: Document how all system actions are logged

### Community Guidelines
- Establish clear contribution guidelines
- Define roles and responsibilities in the governance system
- Document conflict resolution procedures
- Explain how consensus is achieved and measured

## Accessibility Guidelines

### For Technical Audiences
- Include formal specifications (JSON schemas, EBNF grammar)
- Provide API documentation with code examples
- Reference technical standards used in implementation
- Include performance and scaling considerations

### For Non-Technical Audiences
- Create a "Quick Start" guide with simplified steps
- Use analogies to familiar concepts when introducing new ideas
- Provide visual learning paths through the documentation
- Include an expanded glossary with everyday language explanations

### Multilingual Considerations
- Maintain semantic consistency across language versions
- Document translation verification procedures
- Address cultural context adaptations when necessary
- Prioritize clarity over literal translation

## Maintenance Standards

### Version Control
- Document clear versioning scheme (semantic versioning recommended)
- Specify how changes are proposed, reviewed, and merged
- Detail how backward compatibility is maintained or broken
- Include change logs with each version update

### Root Evolution
- Document procedures for root deprecation
- Specify how semantic drift is monitored and addressed
- Explain how conflicts between roots are resolved
- Establish guidelines for root merging and splitting

### Quality Assurance
- Define review criteria for all documentation
- Establish peer review requirements
- Document testing procedures for technical implementations
- Include feedback collection mechanisms

## Ethics Guidelines

### Inclusive Design
- Ensure examples represent diverse perspectives and use cases
- Avoid culturally specific references that may not translate globally
- Use inclusive language throughout documentation
- Consider accessibility for users with disabilities

### Ethical Use
- Document limitations and appropriate uses of Sym-lang
- Include guidance on responsible implementation
- Address potential misuse scenarios and preventive measures
- Provide channels for reporting ethical concerns

### Transparency
- Document all automated processes thoroughly
- Explain how decisions are made and by whom
- Make governance votes and decisions publicly accessible
- Provide clear attribution for all contributions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating a New Root
1. Identify a unique concept not covered by existing roots
2. Draft the root following the structure template
3. Generate meaningful examples for each triptych category
4. Submit for community review with proper metadata
5. Respond to feedback and iterate as needed

### Reviewing Roots
1. Verify technical correctness (syntax, format)
2. Assess semantic clarity and uniqueness
3. Evaluate quality of triptych examples
4. Check metadata completeness
5. Validate against established governance rules

### Documenting Governance Actions
1. Record proposal details with timestamp
2. Document review comments with attribution
3. Record voting results with participation metrics
4. Log final decision with justification
5. Update relevant indexes and references

## Appendix: Templates and Examples

### Root Template
```yaml
root: "#[Prefix]-[Domain]-[Suffix]"
meaning: "[Concise definition ≤140 characters]"
examples:
  human: "[Human perspective example]"
  ai: "[AI processing example]"
  hybrid: "[Human-AI collaboration example]"
metadata:
  author: "@[username]$[ID]"
  created: "[ISO 8601 timestamp]"
  updated: "[ISO 8601 timestamp]" # Optional
```

### Example: Well-Documented Root
```yaml
root: "#Prd-mob-7a2"
meaning: "Smartphone as a mobile extension of human communication."
examples:
  human: "A person using smartphone video calling to maintain long-distance relationships."
  ai: "An AI system analyzing usage patterns to optimize battery life during peak communication hours."
  hybrid: "A user and assistant collaboratively filtering and prioritizing notifications based on contextual importance."
metadata:
  author: "@kairo$15"
  created: "2025-05-20T10:00:00Z"
```

### Governance Process Documentation Example
```
## Exception Request Process

1. **Submission**: Author submits #Exc-3c request with justification
2. **Initial Review**: 72-hour community comment period
3. **Voting**: 7-day voting window (requires 20+ votes)
4. **Decision**: 
   - If ≥55% approval: Exception granted
   - If <55% approval: Exception denied
   - If 45-60% approval: Random council review triggered
5. **Implementation**: Result recorded in root metadata
6. **Circuit-breaker**: System monitors for 3 denials within 30 days
```
